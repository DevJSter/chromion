Perfect. You're building a **Chainlink-powered Auto-Yield Portfolio Manager** — let's break this down step by step. This will be a **non-custodial smart vault** that reallocates user funds into different yield sources automatically based on conditions like APY, time, or price movement.

---

## ✅ 1. **Feature Breakdown (MVP Scope)**

### 🎯 Core User Flow:

1. User deposits ETH or stablecoins (e.g., DAI).
2. Vault allocates funds to a protocol with the highest yield (e.g., Aave, Compound).
3. Chainlink Automation monitors APY/conditions.
4. When another protocol offers better yield, the vault rebalances user funds.

### 🧩 MVP Features:

| Feature                  | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deposit/Withdraw**     | Users can stake and unstake their tokens into the vault.                |
| **Yield Allocation**     | Vault chooses between Aave and Compound based on APY.                   |
| **Chainlink Automation** | Runs a check every X blocks to decide if a rebalance is needed.         |
| **Chainlink Data Feeds** | Fetch APY or interest rate feeds (mocked if real ones are unavailable). |
| **Rebalancer Logic**     | Withdraw from old protocol → deposit into new one automatically.        |
| **UI Dashboard**         | Show current vault status, yields, rebalance events, etc.               |

---

## 🔗 2. **Chainlink Integration Plan**

### 🛠️ Tools You'll Use:

| Tool                     | Purpose                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Automation**           | Automate yield checking + protocol switching.                      |
| **Data Feeds**           | APY or interest rate data (or mock from a price feed for demo).    |
| **Functions (optional)** | Pull custom yield data or external DEX/APR APIs (e.g., DefiLlama). |

### 🔁 Example Automation Flow:

* Every 6 hours, a Chainlink Keeper checks:

  * Aave DAI yield = 3.5%
  * Compound DAI yield = 5.1%
  * ✅ Switch to Compound if delta > 1%

## 🧱 3. **Smart Contract Boilerplate (Vault Skeleton)**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface ILendingProtocol {
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external;
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
    function getAPY() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract YieldVault {
    address public owner;
    address public token; // e.g., DAI
    address public currentProtocol;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    ILendingProtocol public aave;
    ILendingProtocol public compound;

    constructor(address _token, address _aave, address _compound) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        aave = ILendingProtocol(_aave);
        compound = ILendingProtocol(_compound);
    }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        // Transfer tokens and track balance
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        // Withdraw from protocol and return to user
    }

    function rebalance() external {
        // Called by Chainlink Automation
        uint256 aaveAPY = aave.getAPY();
        uint256 compoundAPY = compound.getAPY();

        if (compoundAPY > aaveAPY + 100) {
            // Withdraw from Aave → Deposit to Compound
            currentProtocol = address(compound);
        } else if (aaveAPY > compoundAPY + 100) {
            // Withdraw from Compound → Deposit to Aave
            currentProtocol = address(aave);
        }
    }
}
```

🛠️ Add access control, reentrancy guard, and real token logic for production. This is a clean MVP.

## ⚙️ 4. **Frontend Idea (Tailwind + Ethers.js)**

### 📄 Pages/Components:

1. **Dashboard**

   * [x] Current vault value
   * [x] Current protocol (Aave/Compound)
   * [x] Estimated APY
   * [x] Rebalance logs

2. **Deposit/Withdraw**

   * Simple form to stake/unstake tokens

3. **Yield Comparison Graph**

   * (Optional) Chart of past APYs (mock or real)

### 💻 Stack:

| Component            | Tech                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| UI                   | TailwindCSS + React            |
| Wallet               | RainbowKit / Wagmi / Ethers.js |
| Chainlink Automation | Register upkeep job            |
| Charting             | Chart.js or Recharts (for APY) |

---

### 🧠 DEX Integration: **Needed?**

Not directly **at MVP**, but:

* You’ll **need token swaps** *if* the vault supports yield in multiple tokens.
* For example, if yield on Compound is in cDAI, and you want to switch to ETH → DEX call required (Uniswap or 1inch).
* You can **mock this step** to keep things simple for the hackathon — say all vaults use DAI.

---

## 🎁 Optional Power-Ups (for judging bonus):

* Chainlink **Functions** to fetch live APYs from DefiLlama or APIs.
* UI leaderboard: Top users based on ROI
* Add **NFT vault access** (only holders can use it)

Would you like me to scaffold the contract with proper token logic and mock lending protocol interfaces? Or generate a React/Tailwind UI shell you can plug into?


Perfect. Here's a clear, **high-level overview** of your Chainlink hackathon project:

# 🚀 Project: **Auto-Yield Vault**

> A smart contract vault that **automatically reallocates user funds** between lending protocols (like Aave and Compound) to **optimize yield**, powered by **Chainlink Automation + Data Feeds**.

## 🧠 Concept Summary

| Aspect           | Description                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Problem**      | DeFi users must manually chase yield, which is inefficient and error-prone.                                              |
| **Solution**     | A non-custodial smart vault that uses Chainlink to monitor yields and auto-switch funds to the most profitable protocol. |
| **Target Users** | DeFi investors who want passive optimized returns.                                                                       |

## 🔗 Chainlink Usage

| Tool                      | Purpose                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automation**            | Calls `rebalance()` on the vault every few hours.                   |
| **Data Feeds / Mock APY** | Feeds current yields from Aave/Compound (or mocked).                |
| **(Optional) Functions**  | Pull live APYs from APIs like DeFi Llama, if you want extra credit. |

## 🧪 Demo Plan

* Deploy mock Aave and Compound contracts with different APY values
* Show funds being moved from one protocol to another
* Use Chainlink Automation to trigger `rebalance()` on testnet (Sepolia/Optimism Sepolia)
* Use test tokens (DAI) for user deposits
* Frontend shows vault state updating in real-time

---

## 🔥 Judge-Winning Angles

* **Real-world use case**: Users want this today.
* **Chainlink native**: Clean integration with Automation + Feeds.
* **Solo-friendly**: Smart scope, yet looks impressive.
* **Bonus potential**: Add AI suggestions, NFTs, leaderboard, or Telegram alerts later.

Let me know which part you want to build next:

* Vault contract with mock protocol hooks?
* Mock lending contracts with fixed APYs?
* Frontend starter template?
* Chainlink Automation example?

Just say the word — I’ll scaffold it fast.
