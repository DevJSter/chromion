- **Optimized Automation**: Rebalancing optimized for 1-second block times

## 🎯 Why This Approach Wins

### Technical Innovation
```bash
# Traditional DeFi: Pay ETH gas fees, limited by network congestion
Old Way: $50+ transaction fees, 12+ second finality, network congestion

# Chromion Subnet: Pay CHRM gas fees, instant finality, no congestion  
Our Way: $0.001 transaction fees, <1 second finality, 10,000+ TPS
```

### Economic Innovation
- **Gas Token Control**: Users earn CHRM through yield farming participation
- **Fee Redistribution**: Gas fees fund protocol development and user rewards
- **Sustainable Economics**: Custom tokenomics designed for long-term ecosystem growth
- **Yield Multipliers**: CHRM stakers get boosted APY on all protocols

### User Experience Innovation
- **Instant Transactions**: Sub-second finality enables real-time portfolio rebalancing
- **Micro-Fee Structure**: Enables high-frequency optimization strategies previously impossible
- **Native Rewards**: Users earn CHRM tokens for every interaction in the ecosystem
- **Seamless UX**: No network switching - everything happens on one optimized chain

You're building a Chainlink-powered Auto-Yield Portfolio Manager on a custom Avalanche subnet. This is a non-custodial smart vault that reallocates user funds into different yield sources automatically, powered by your own blockchain infrastructure.

## 1. Feature Breakdown (Custom Subnet MVP)

### Core User Flow on Chromion Chain

1. User deposits DAI using CHRM gas fees (ultra-low cost)
2. The vault allocates funds to the highest-yield custom protocol (ChromAave or ChromCompound)  
3. Chainlink Automation monitors APY leveraging 1-second block times
4. When another protocol offers better yield, vault rebalances instantly with minimal CHRM fees
5. Users earn both protocol yields AND CHRM token rewards

### Automation Flow on Chromion

Every block (1 second), Chainlink Automation checks:

- ChromAave DAI yield = 3.5% + CHRM rewards
- ChromCompound DAI yield = 5.1% + CHRM rewards  
- Switch protocols if difference > 1% (instant execution, ~$0.001 gas)

## 3. Smart Contract Boilerplate (Vault Skeleton)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface ILendingProtocol {
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external;
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;
    function getAPY() external view returns (uint256);
}

contract YieldVault {
    address public owner;
    address public token; // e.g., DAI
    address public currentProtocol;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    ILendingProtocol public aave;
    ILendingProtocol public compound;

    constructor(address _token, address _aave, address _compound) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        token = _token;
        aave = ILendingProtocol(_aave);
        compound = ILendingProtocol(_compound);
    }

    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        // Transfer tokens and track balance
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
        // Withdraw from protocol and return to user
    }

    function rebalance() external {
        // Called by Chainlink Automation
        uint256 aaveAPY = aave.getAPY();
        uint256 compoundAPY = compound.getAPY();

        if (compoundAPY > aaveAPY + 100) {
            // Withdraw from Aave and deposit to Compound
            currentProtocol = address(compound);
        } else if (aaveAPY > compoundAPY + 100) {
            // Withdraw from Compound and deposit to Aave
            currentProtocol = address(aave);
        }
    }
}
```

Add access control, reentrancy guard, and real token logic for production. This is a clean MVP.

### DEX Integration: Needed?

Not directly at MVP, but:

- You’ll need token swaps if the vault supports yield in multiple tokens.
- For example, if yield on Compound is in cDAI, and you want to switch to ETH, a DEX call is required (Uniswap or 1inch).
- You can mock this step to keep things simple for the hackathon — assume all vaults use DAI.

---

## Optional Power-Ups (for judging bonus)

- Chainlink Functions to fetch live APYs from DefiLlama or APIs.
- UI leaderboard: Top users based on ROI
- Add NFT vault access (only holders can use it)

Would you like me to scaffold the contract with proper token logic and mock lending protocol interfaces? Or generate a React/Tailwind UI shell you can plug into?

# Project: Auto-Yield Vault

A smart contract vault that automatically reallocates user funds between lending protocols (like Aave and Compound) to optimize yield, powered by Chainlink Automation and Data Feeds.

## Concept Summary

| Aspect           | Description                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Problem          | DeFi users must manually chase yield, which is inefficient and error-prone.                                              |
| Solution         | A non-custodial smart vault that uses Chainlink to monitor yields and auto-switch funds to the most profitable protocol. |
| Target Users     | DeFi investors who want passive optimized returns.                                                                       |

## Demo Plan

- Deploy mock Aave and Compound contracts with different APY values
- Show funds being moved from one protocol to another
- Use Chainlink Automation to trigger `rebalance()` on testnet (Sepolia/Optimism Sepolia)
- Use test tokens (DAI) for user deposits
- Frontend shows vault state updating in real-time
